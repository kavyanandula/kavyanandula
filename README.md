## Project 1: Geolocation Prediction

### Description
Developed a multimodal deep learning model for geolocation prediction based on Twitter texts and timestamps. This model achieved a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of **10.615**, outperforming traditional unimodal methods.

### Key Features
- Utilizes both text data from tweets and temporal information for improved accuracy.
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of multimodal approaches in geographical predictions.

### Results
- RMSE: **10.615**
- Surpassed unimodal methods in performance.

## Project 2: Crime Analysis

### Description
Developed predictive models for crime analysis using Random Forest algorithms. The project focuses on analyzing crime data to identify patterns and predict crime occurrences.

### Key Features
- Implements machine learning techniques to classify and predict crime-related events.
- Achieved an accuracy of **86.86%** using the Random Forest model.

### Results
- Accuracy: **86.86%**

## Project 3: Seismic Risk Assessment

### Description
Working on a project related to machine learning-based seismic risk assessment using street view images. This project aims to analyze urban structures to evaluate potential risks associated with seismic events.

### Key Features
- Leverages street view images to gather data on building types and conditions.
- Utilizes machine learning techniques to assess risk and vulnerability.

## Technologies Used
